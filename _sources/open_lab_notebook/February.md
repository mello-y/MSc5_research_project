What I did today:
- plotted mean distribution of CT values for control and patient group using a violin plot
- started micro-structural data section with information regarding Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Fractional Anisotropy (FA)
- added information and comments to the notebook

To-do next time working on the project:
- look for specific brain regions to compare between control and patient group in CT
- start exploring the micro-structural data
