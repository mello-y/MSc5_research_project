 - tried to find the derived atlas (from the Desikan-Killiany) that was used in the paper with 308 cortical regions
 - researched about how to plot brain atlases (FreeSurfer, Nilearn, ggseg R module)

## Wednesday, 07/12/2022

- tried to use the ggseg module and find a way how to use R within python since ggseg is a R module; to load the standard Desikan-Killiany atlas because I was not able to find the files for the derived atlas
- ggseg module did not work, could not figure it out

## Friday, 09/12/2022

## Tuesday, 28/12/2022

 - provided more information for github repo
