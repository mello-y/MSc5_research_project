## Introduction

Key features of psychotic disoders include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms (7). Typically, the diagnosis is made according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disoders (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 

Machine learning methods (for example, support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression) (4,9) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (8,10) become apparent as a new  approach to support the diagnosis of mental disorders.

Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that makes computer algorithms feasible to learn patterns by studying data directly without being explicitly programmed.15 Within the realm of medicine, ML has been applied with regard to diagnosis and outcome prediction. 16

However, many studies have employed machine learning (ML) algorhitms to identify or diagnose psychotic disorders or schizophrenia based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (1-8). The results of the studies reveal a great variability in the accuracies (1) and ML has been described as a "black box", indicating that there is no consistent pattern which of the MRI modalities are most effective for achieving accurate machine classification.
