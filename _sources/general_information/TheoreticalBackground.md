# Introduction

Key features of psychotic disoders include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms ([Arciniegas, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455840/)). Typically, the diagnosis is made according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disoders ([American Psychiatric Association, 2013](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-14907-000)) and interviews, lacking the use of objective biomarkers. A biomarker is defined as a " characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. In practical terms, a biomarker refers to a broad subcategory of medical signs – that is, objective indications of medical state observed from outside the patient – which can be measured accurately and reproducibly" ([Correll et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214698/)). Since the above mentioned symptoms are not unique to the disorder and can be seen across a wide range of mental disorders, plus the disease exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity and individual variability, biomarkers associated with psychotic disorders could provide relief in the diagnostic process. 

Machine learning methods (for example, support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression) ([Rezaii et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-019-0077-9), [Stamate et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996419301616?casa_token=NlqxH4KA11oAAAAA:uShKU5O6khxfPODAPxLEz5kbgw-LNeDWCZye1kc8Qvcih7ymMgDBbsGWKVV4CSh0UhoeUztT0w)) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ([Mikolas et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-018-1678-y),[ Qi-yong Gong et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/46/1/17/5365736?login=false)) become apparent as a new approach to support the diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that makes computer algorithms feasible to learn patterns by studying data directly without being explicitly programmed ([Noble, 2006](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1206-1565)). Within the realm of medicine, ML has increasingly been applied with regard to diagnosis and outcome prediction ([Azimi et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24987050/.)). Neuroimaging measures assessed with MRI could serve as biomarkers making it feasible to evaluate prognostic accuracy (5).
Many studies have employed machine learning (ML) algorhitms to identify or diagnose psychotic disorders or schizophrenia based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data ([Dwyer et al.,2018](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/44/5/1060/4911426), [Lei et al., 2019](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/detecting-schizophrenia-at-the-level-of-the-individual-relative-d), [Vieira et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942152/)). 

Studies of psychotic disorders using structural MRI reveal widespread neuroanatomic abnormalities in cortical thickness and total brain measures ([Shenton et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC129100/)). For example, the results of the studies by [Kuperberg et al. (2003)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12963669/) and [Rimol et al. (2010)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20609836/) reveal reduced cortical thicknessn in the frontal and temporal lobes but also to some extent in parietal and occipital regions. Furthermore, [Del Casale et al. (2021)](http://www.architalbiol.org/index.php/aib/article/view/1593) compared patients with first episode psychosis and multi-episode schizophrenia with healty controls and found that the multi-episode group showed cortical thickness reduction in left temporal and parietal, and right temporal, parietal, occipital, and hippocampal cortices. Another study by [Asmal et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27572938/) examined frontal cortical thickness in first-episode schizophrenia with healthy controls. The results reveal reduced cortical thickness for a number of frontal regions such as left medial orbitofrontal, left superior frontal, left frontal pole, right rostral middle frontal, right lateral orbitofrontal and right superior frontal regions in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Another study by [Jung et al. (2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20026559/) compared corical thickness in individuals at ultra-high-risk (UHR) for psychosis, patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. The authors found out that UHR group showed significant cortical thickness  reduction in the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus compared with healthy control subjects. When compared schizophrenia group and UHR group, reductions in the above mentioned regions plus posterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and precentral cortex were found in the schizophrenia group. All these studies show that reduced cortical thickness is a common finding in psychotic disorders.

However, functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging studies of psychotic disorders show aberrant functional and structural connectivity, stressing networks and dysfunctional connectivity rather than brain regions acting in isolation ([Meyer- Lindenberg et al., 2005](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/208512), [Bassett et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2878961/), [Lynall et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20631176/)). For example, resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) studies reveal reduced connectivity within and between large-scale cortical networks, especially those involving frontal and temporal cortex ([Baker et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988201/)).Studies reveal that disprutions in strucutral connectivity related to psychotic disorder as measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) show brain-wide reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) ([Kubicki et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16023676/)). Addiotionally, mean diffusivity (MD) has been found to be increased in several brain regions, including the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and corpus callosum, indicating increased water diffusion and potentially disrupted white matter microstructure. 

Due to those finding, these MRI metrics has been discussed multiple times in the literature as potential biomarkers for psychotic disorders. However, the results of the studies using machine learning to predict psychotic disorder based on different MRI metrics reveal a great variability in the accuracies ([Arbabshirani et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381191600210X) and ML has been described as a "black box", indicating that is is not clear which of the MRI metrics are most informative for achieving accurate machine classification. 
 
 While the majority of studies have focused on functional MRI (fMRI),diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures have been underrepresented in the literature ([Ardekani et al., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896986/#bib34)) in predicting psychotic disorder. This research project aims to gain more insights in the  predicting psychotic disorder specifically using macrostructural MRI data (cortical thickness (CT)) and microstructural MRI data (mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)) with respect to their accuracies. I hypothesize that microstructural data provides more accuracy in in predicting psychotic disorder than macrostructural data.
