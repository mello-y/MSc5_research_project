Before starting with our first modality being **cortical thickness (CT)**, the learning problem and the task type should be defined to know which model suits the best for the purpose of the project aim."

    "SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used that can be used for classifcation, regression and outliers detection (for further information click here). The basic idea is to find an optimal separating line (or hyperplane) as output that separates the data into two classes. The SVM algorithm looks for the data points that are the clostest to the line from both classes. These points are called support vectors. Then, the distance between the support vectors and the hyperplane which is called the margin is computed. To find the best and optimal hyperplane, the margin should be maximized.\n"
