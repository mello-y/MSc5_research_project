## Overview

This research project deals with predicting psychosis disorder using machine learning based on different MRI metrics and is conducted in the MSc05 course in the Neurocognitive Psychology lab at Goethe University Frankfurt within the psychology master.

The aim of the project is to use different brain modality data, ranging from macro-structural MRI, micro-structural MRI, fMRI, functional MRI connectivity and network analysis to structural connectivity and DWI tractography to predict which of the brain modalities provide more accuracy in classifying participants either as control (and therefore healthy) or patient with psychotic disorder. 

The data at hand originates from the paper "Functional MRI connectivity accurately distinguishes cases with psychotic disorders from healthy controls, based on cortical features associated with brain network development" by [Young et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/19009894) and is available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Functional_MRI_connectivity_accurately_distinguishes_cases_with_psychotic_disorders_from_healthy_controls_based_on_cortical_features_associated_with_brain_network_development_/12361550).
