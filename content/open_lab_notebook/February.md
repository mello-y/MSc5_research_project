# February, 2023

## Monday, 06/02/2023
What I did today:
- adjusted file paths in the Data analysis notebook and Data exploration notebook and used relative paths and plat-form independent paths to ensure reproducibility 

To-do next time working on the project:
- interpret ROC curve
- finalise logistic regression section in the Data analysis notebook
- start with the SVM section in the Data analysis notebook
- Work on Issue #2 on github 

## Monday, 13/02/2023
What I did today:
- computed logistic regression for microstructural data
- plotted brain region differences between controls and patients for the macrostructural data and microstructural data

To-do next time working on the project:
- intepret ROC curve
- provide more information on logistic regression section
- compute SVM for macro and microstructural data
- Read into Gridsearch to see how results differ whith different parameters

## Wednesday, 16/02/2023
What I did today:
- created new notebook for SVM and computed pipelines for macro- and microstructural data

To-do next time working on the project:
- Read into Gridsearch to see how results differ whith different parameters
- provide more information on logistic regression and SVM section
- intepret ROC curves


## Thursday 23/02/2023
What I did today:
- provided more information on logistic regression and SVM notebook
- intepreted ROC curve for macrostructural data
- worked on the issue to standardise before splitting the data

To-do next time working on the project:
- intepret ROC curve for microstructural data
- Read into Gridsearch to see how results differ whith different parameters
- provide more information on logistic regression and SVM notebook for microstructual data
- cross-validate SVM and logistic regression for macro- and microstructural data
