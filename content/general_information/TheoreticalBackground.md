# Introduction

Key features of psychotic disoders include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms [Arciniegas, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455840/). Typically, the diagnosis is made according to the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disoders ([American Psychiatric Association, 2013](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-14907-000)) and interviews, lacking the use of objective biomarkers. A biomarker is defined as a " characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. In practical terms, a biomarker refers to a broad subcategory of medical signs – that is, objective indications of medical state observed from outside the patient – which can be measured accurately and reproducibly" ([Correll et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20214698/)). Since the above mentioned symptoms are not unique to the disorder and can be seen across a wide range of mental disorders, plus the disease exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity and individual variability, biomarkers associated with psychotic disorders could provide relief in the diagnostic process. 

Machine learning methods (for example, support vector machines, random forest, logistic regression) ([Rezaii et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41537-019-0077-9),[Stamate et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996419301616?casa_token=NlqxH4KA11oAAAAA:uShKU5O6khxfPODAPxLEz5kbgw-LNeDWCZye1kc8Qvcih7ymMgDBbsGWKVV4CSh0UhoeUztT0w)) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ([Mikolas et al., 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-018-1678-y),[ Qi-yong Gong et al., 2018](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/46/1/17/5365736?login=false)) become apparent as a new approach to support the diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence (AI) that makes computer algorithms feasible to learn patterns by studying data directly without being explicitly programmed [Noble, 2006](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1206-1565). Within the realm of medicine, ML has increasingly been applied with regard to diagnosis and outcome prediction [Azimi et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24987050/.). Neuroimaging measures assessed with MRI could serve as biomarkers making it feasible to evaluate prognostic accuracy (5).
Many studies have employed machine learning (ML) algorhitms to identify or diagnose psychotic disorders or schizophrenia based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data ([Dwyer et al.,2018](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/44/5/1060/4911426), [Lei et al., 2019](https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/detecting-schizophrenia-at-the-level-of-the-individual-relative-d), [Vieira et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6942152/)). It has been reported multiple times that brain connectivity measures show aberrant functional and structural connectivity across psychotic disorders (9-14). Resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI) studies reveal reduced connectivity within and between large-scale cortical networks (6), especially those involving frontal and temporal cortex (15). Besides that, studies show that disprutions in strucutral connectivity related to psychotic disorder as measured by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) show brain-wide reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) (21). 
DTI measures are also underrepresented in current studies(33, 35, 36), making their diagnostic utility unclear.
 The results of the studies reveal a great variability in the accuracies [Arbabshirani et al., 2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S105381191600210X) and ML has been described as a "black box", indicating that is is not clear which of the MRI metrics are most informative for achieving accurate machine classification. 
In this project, however, I want to use macrostructural MRI data (cortical thickness (CT)) and microstructural MRI data (mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA)) to see which of the metrics provide the best classification accuracy.

Will provide further information
