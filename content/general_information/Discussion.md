# Reflection on the research project

With almost no to little experience in computational neuroscience and basic coding skills, I decided to take the research module for the following reasons: my enthusiasm for the brain, the methodology with which the brain can be studied and artificial intelligence. If only I had known what I was getting myself into ... I would have done it again, but this time differently. 

The whole process was characterised by ups and downs. Thanks to the very well prepared material (at this point, a huge thank you to Peer), I had the opportunity to read up and dive on the variety of topics. I didn't always understand everything straight away, the topics weren't and aren't easy fare, but with continuous engagement with the topic, I felt comfortable with the various concepts over time. It was also helpful to know that I could ask my tutors at any time (at this point, a huge thank you to Peer, Michael and Jack). I am grateful to have gained valuable experience, be it related to what really matters when designing a research project from scratch, considering various factors that make it transparent in terms of open science, or with computational neuroscience topics in general. I have learned that it is a process that takes a long time and is not linear. You have to reckon with setbacks because maybe a code doesn't work or you can't put an idea into practice or does not understand what is happening. But the process continues and you learn whether you want to or not.

In retrospect, I would have done many things differently. First, I would have tried to develop a much more solid foundation for myself. By this I mean that I would have liked to invest more time in researching the literature before finally deciding on a topic and spending more time in understanding the basics to the fullest. The same goes for the selection of the data set. My initial idea was to find a dataset that explores many different MRI metrics for the "full experience". While this is the case for the dataset I used for this project, I underestimated how much time it would take to understand this data. Understanding how it was measured, what it says and how to process it in code. Unfortunately, I was not able to work with all types of data as originally planned. The short-term acceptance for my semester abroad also contributed a lot to this, which is why I was not able to spend the time on this project that I would have liked to. Many other things that were planned I could not accomplish be it working with the other metrics and also in terms of multimodal dataintegration. What I mean to say is that I'm sure I could have made more of the project with a more solid foundation, spending more time in understanding the basics to have it easier in implementing them in practice. I would also have liked to use the opportunity to contact our tutors more often afterwards and ask for help. 

Nevertheless, it was a very educational experience. I liked the combination of theoretical input and practical implementation. I am very happy to have learned how useful it is to work with version control and what it actually means to set up a machine learning algorithm and the functionality behind these methods and having gained more knowledge regarding micro- and macrostructural data. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people from the Fiebach Lab once again for this great module and the wonderful time!
