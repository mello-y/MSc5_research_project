What I did today: 
- Read the paper "Functional MRI connectivity accurately distinguishes cases with psychotic disorders from healthy controls, based on cortical features associated with neurodevelopment" by Morgan et al. (2019) until the data section
- Made a list of literature to read for psychosis as a brain network disorder
- Made an overview of the data and what the data contains (google doc)
- Made a list of questions regarding the data I don't understand (google doc)
- Went through the first section of course website (Cortical Maps)

To-do for next time working on the project:
- read psychosis paper (ET Bullmore, S Frangou, and RM Murray. The dysplastic net hypothesis: an integration of developmental and dysconnectivity theories of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia Research, 28: 143–156, 1997.)
- go through the list of questions regarding the data and research to get a better undestanding of the data
- work on notebook and the data exploration section
- briefly read the ML section (Morgan et al., 2019)
