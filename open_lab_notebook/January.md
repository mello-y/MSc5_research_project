## Monday, 16/01/2023
What I did today:
- provided more information regarding the structure and overview for the github repository
- computed the  distributions of means for the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy data and plotted them using a violin plot
- created Data analysis notebook and defined the learning problem (supervised) and task type (classification)
- read in about SVM 

To-do next time working on the project:
- get a better understanding of SVM 
- get an idea of how to implement SVM in python

## Tuesday, 17/01/2023
What I did today:
- read in about SVM and understood the underlying concept and logic
- decided to use linearSVC as algorithm for the classification task
- provided information in the Data analysis notebook on SVMs and linearSVC

To-do next time working on the project:
- apply the logic of SVC to my data 
- read in about features and feature selection and apply to my data 
- get an idea of how to implement linearSVC in python (the structure of the pipeline)


## Wednesday, 18/01/2023
What I did today:
- wrote a SVM pipeline in python (still needs to be further developed)
- read about Logistic Regression and understood the underlying concept and logic
- thought about how to implement Logistic Regression in python (the structure of the pipeline)

To-do next time working on the project:
- compute a logistic regression pipeline in python


## Friday, 20/01/2023
What I did today:
- computed a logistic regression pipeline in python for the first 5 brain regions

To-do next time working on the project:
- compute a logistic regression pipeline in python for the remaining brain regions
- provide more information on SVM and Logistic Regression in the Data analysis notebook
-

## Wednesday, 25/01/2023
What I did today:
- merged content of main branch into update branch to now work on update branch
- structured repo, moved notebooks into code folder
- read in more on logistic regression 

To-do next time working on the project:
- compute a logistic regression pipeline in python 

## Thursday, 26/01/2023
What I did today:
- computed a logistic regression pipeline in python, restructred it 

To-do next time working on the project:
- plot logistic regression resullts 
- provide more information on logistic regression in the Data analysis notebook
- restructre data analysis notebook

## Friday, 27/01/2023
What I did today:
- provided more information on logistic regression in the Data analysis notebook
- restructred data analysis notebook, specifically the logistic regression section
- created ROC curve for logistic regression
- failed to plot logistic regression results. The error message says that for the regplot function the input data must be 1-dimensional. For my y variable this was the case, for X it was not. I tried to reshape the X variable, but this did not work. I will try to fix this next time.

To-do next time working on the project:
- plot logistic regression results
- interpret ROC curve
- provide more information on logistic regression in the Data analysis notebook
- start with the SVM section in the Data analysis notebook

## Monday, 30/01/2023
What I did today:
- provided more information on logistic regression in the Data analysis notebook
- interpreted confusion matrix and evaluation measures
- failed to plit logistic regression results; since there is no need to plot the results, I will not try to fix this anymore

To-do next time working on the project:
- interpret ROC curve
- finalise logistic regression section in the Data analysis notebook
- start with the SVM section in the Data analysis notebook


## Monday, 06/02/2023
What I did today:
- adjusted file paths in the Data analysis notebook and Data exploration notebook and used relative paths and plat-form independent paths to ensure reproducibility 

To-do next time working on the project:
- interpret ROC curve
- finalise logistic regression section in the Data analysis notebook
- start with the SVM section in the Data analysis notebook
- Work on Issue #2 on github
