## Monday, 16/01/2023
What I did today:
- provided more information regarding the structure and overview for the github repository
- computed the  distributions of means for the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy data and plotted them using a violin plot
- created Data analysis notebook and defined the learning problem (supervised) and task type (classification)
- read in about SVM 

To-do next time working on the project:
- get a better understanding of SVM 
- get an idea of how to implement SVM in python

## Tuesday, 17/01/2023
What I did today:
- read in about SVM and understood the underlying concept and logic
- decided to use linearSVC as algorithm for the classification task
- provided information in the Data analysis notebook on SVMs and linearSVC

To-do next time working on the project:
- apply the logic of SVC to my data 
- read in about features and feature selection and apply to my data 
- get an idea of how to implement linearSVC in python (the structure of the pipeline)


## Wednesday, 18/01/2023
What I did today:
- wrote a SVM pipeline in python (still needs to be further developed)
- read about Logistic Regression and understood the underlying concept and logic
- thought about how to implement Logistic Regression in python (the structure of the pipeline)

To-do next time working on the project:
- compute a logistic regression pipeline in python


## Friday, 20/01/2023
What I did today:
- computed a logistic regression pipeline in python for the first 5 brain regions

To-do next time working on the project:
- compute a logistic regression pipeline in python for the remaining brain regions
- provide more information on SVM and Logistic Regression in the Data analysis notebook
