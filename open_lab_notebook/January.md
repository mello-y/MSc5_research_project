What I did today:
- provided more information regarding the structure and overview for the github repository
- computed the  distributions of means for the mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy data and plotted them using a violin plot
- created Data analysis notebook and defined the learning problem (supervised) and task type (classification)
- read in about SVM 

To-do next time working on the project:
- get a better understanding of SVM 
- get an idea of how to implement SVM in python
